# Partical Automation Script TCM Securirty Practical Windows Forensics
 
## Introduction

- Created a automation script to run forensic executable tools in python.
- The automation script was meant to speed up the process of gathering information about registry, master file table, appcompactcache, and prefetch 

## Thought Process

- The thought process for this project was to automatically parse the registry, master file table, appcompactcache, and prefetch.
- Time was saved, analysis was done quickly and more effecitently.

## What I Learned

- I learned how to run executables in python using subprocess module.
- How to create multiple sleeps so output that was sent to the command line can be easily read and copied to a report.
- What i can do to expand on this code in the future is add operating system module to create directorys tools, and analysis. Also, add a line in the python code to parse a mounted drive using kape triage.

## Mark

- Extra Curricular.
